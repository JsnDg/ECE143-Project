# ECE143-Project:Prediction of Forest Fires Based on Meteorological Analysis

Authors: Group 11:Zijian Ding, Gitika Karumuri, Kunmao Li, Jianing Zhang

Project Description:
We will be analyzing a dataset collected from forests in the northeast region of Portugal. Firstly, we will establish relationships between the meteorological factors correlated to forest fires(e.g. temperature, wind, FFMC, DMC). We will then apply the relationship to building a prediction system for forest fires. The system will calculate and give feedback on the probability of potential forest fires using SVM.

Dataset link:http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/forest-fires/ rates fire hazards based on both natural factors, such as humidity, as well as artificial factors, such as litter. All data is collected from Montesinho park, located in Portugal, with more than 570 instances through 2001 to 2003.
